	<h1>Time, Space, and Complexity</h1>
	<p>Performin a algorithm with worst case Time Complexity make algorithm efficient</p>
	<p>Big O Notation: Like time complexity, <b>Space Complexity</b> is often expressed using Big O notation. This notation provides an upper bound on the space requirements of an algorithm in the worst-case scenario. For example, O(n) indicates that the space required grows linearly with the input size.</p>
